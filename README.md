# Reactive Swift


An implementation of Colin Eberhardt's  [raywenderlich.com ReactiveCocoa tutorial][wenderlich] in Swift.

I've been playing around trying to get [ReactiveCocoa][reactivecocoa_github] to play nice with [Swift][swift_lang].

For more information, see my [blog post][blogpost] which goes into detail about the interop issues and workarounds.

## Installation

After cloning, you'll want to initialize the `ReactiveCocoa` submodule by doing:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
Run script/bootstrap from within the ReactiveCocoa folder
``` 

This will check out [my fork][rc_fork] of ReactiveCocoa, which has a workaround for a Swift compiler error.
